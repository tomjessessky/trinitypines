                Independence is easy!  There is so much to see and do in Lake Mills from
                playing a round of golf, to cruising or fishing on Rock Lake, weekly Farmer's
                Markets in the park and music and arts options.  Come and go as you please
                with the peace of mind knowing your apartment is secure.  Are you a snowbird?
                We'll take care of things while you are away!

                family and friends in any of the common areas like the large library with
                baby grand piano. Perhaps you'd like to sit and chat by the fireplace with
                a cup of coffee?
